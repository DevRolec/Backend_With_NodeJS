Node.js REPL and core APIs overview
## Tutorial...
REPL = (Read-Eval-Print-Loop)
This is an interactive environment built in nodeJS  where u can execute JavaScript code.
Read -> Read input from the User
Eval -> Evaluate the input
Print -> Prints the result
Loop -> Goes back to wait for more input

**Navigation within REPL
.help -> Shows all REPL command
.exit -> Exit
.clear -> Resets the REPL
.load file -> Loads JS file into REPL
.save file -> Saves the REPL session

** Working on REPL features.
-> functions
-> underscore
-> Variable Persistence
