# 6 Steps to Becoming a Professional JavaScript Backend Developer

A structured breakdown of the topics reflecting current global industry practices.

## 1. Core JavaScript & Asynchronous Programming ‚òï

### Language Fundamentals (Deep Dive)
* **Execution Context & Scope:** Understanding scope chains, lexical environment, and the `this` keyword.
* **Prototypes & Inheritance:** Mastering prototypal inheritance, constructor functions, and the ES6 `class` syntax.
* **Closures:** Deeply understanding how functions remember their lexical scope.
* **ES Modules vs. CommonJS:** Knowing the difference between `import`/`export` and `require()`/`module.exports`.
* **Tutorial**
* The this Keyword
The this keyword is a special variable whose value is determined by how a function is called.
```js
const person = {
  name: 'Ada',
  greet: function() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`); // 'this' refers to 'person'
  }
};

person.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is Ada.
```
In a Simple Function Call: In "strict mode," this is undefined. In "sloppy mode," it refers to the global object (window in browsers).
```js
function showThis() {
  'use strict';
  console.log(this);
}

showThis(); // Output: undefined
```


In an Object Method: this refers to the object the method is called on.
Prototypes & Inheritance
JavaScript is a prototype-based language. This means objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects. 
Each object has a private property which holds a link to another object called its prototype. 
That prototype object has a prototype of its own, and so on, until an object is reached with null as its prototype.

Constructor Functions
This was the "classic" way to create objects before the class keyword. A constructor function is used with the new keyword to create instances.
Methods are typically added to the prototype property for efficiency, so they are shared across all instances.
```js
// Constructor function
function Dog(name, breed) {
  this.name = name;
  this.breed = breed;
}

// Add a shared method to the Dog prototype
Dog.prototype.bark = function() {
  console.log(`Woof! My name is ${this.name}.`);
};

const dog1 = new Dog('Rex', 'German Shepherd');
const dog2 = new Dog('Buddy', 'Golden Retriever');

dog1.bark(); // Output: Woof! My name is Rex.
dog2.bark(); // Output: Woof! My name is Buddy.
```
ES6 class Syntax
The class syntax introduced in ES6 is primarily "syntactic sugar" over the existing prototype-based inheritance. It provides a cleaner, more familiar syntax for creating objects and handling inheritance.
```js
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} makes a noise.`);
  }
}

// Cat inherits from Animal
class Cat extends Animal {
  constructor(name, breed) {
    super(name); // Calls the parent class's constructor
    this.breed = breed;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} meows.`); // Overrides the parent method
  }
}

const myCat = new Cat('Whiskers', 'Siamese');
myCat.speak(); // Output: Whiskers meows.
```
Closures
A closure is a function that remembers and has access to variables from its outer (enclosing) scope, even after that outer function has finished executing.

Think of it like a backpack. When a function is created, it packs all the variables it needs from its parent's scope into a "backpack" (the closure). It can then carry this backpack around and access those variables whenever it's called.

Example: A Counter
The classic example is a counter function. The inner function has access to the count variable from its parent's scope.
```js
function createCounter() {
  let count = 0; // 'count' is in the backpack of the returned function

  return function() {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  };
}

const counter1 = createCounter(); // Creates one backpack (closure)
const counter2 = createCounter(); // Creates a separate backpack

counter1(); // Output: 1
counter1(); // Output: 2

counter2(); // Output: 1 (This is a separate count)
```
ES Modules vs. CommonJS
These are two different systems for organizing your code into reusable files, or "modules."

CommonJS (CJS)
This is the module system that has been traditionally used by Node.js.

Syntax: Uses require() to import and module.exports to export.

Loading: It's synchronous. When you require a module, Node.js stops everything until that file is loaded and parsed.

Environment: Primarily server-side (Node.js).
```js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

const PI = 3.14;

module.exports = {
  add,
  PI
};
```
* Common JS
 ```js
  const myMath = require('./math.js');

console.log(myMath.add(5, 10)); // Output: 15
console.log(myMath.PI); // Output: 3.14
```
ES Modules (ESM)
This is the modern, official standard for JavaScript, supported by all modern browsers and recent versions of Node.js.

Syntax: Uses import and export statements.

Loading: It's asynchronous. This allows for better performance, especially in browsers.

Environment: Works in browsers and Node.js (in .mjs files or by setting "type": "module" in package.json).
```js
export function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

export const PI = 3.14;

// You can also have a 'default' export
// export default someFunction;
```
```js
import { add, PI } from './math.mjs';

console.log(add(5, 10)); // Output: 15
console.log(PI); // Output: 3.14
```
